## Project Components
1. **Use Case Model** - Modeling different user interactions with the system.
2. **ER Diagram** - Outlining persistent data and their relationships.
3. **Class Diagram** - Detailing the system's architecture and object-oriented structure.
4. **Sequence Diagram** - Describing object interactions based on sequence.
5. **Communication Diagram** - Illustrating the interactions between objects in terms of their messages.
6. **State Diagram** - Displaying the state changes of the system through various events.

## Assignment Variant
The system is designed for a dog breeding station that requires detailed tracking and management of dog data, including breed, health records, and pedigree information. Key features include vaccination tracking, weight and height monitoring, and pedigree printing through a web interface.
